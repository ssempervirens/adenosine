PDS:
- keys in MST (repo) should NOT have leading slash (!)

CLI:
- register and login commands should do more than just dump JSON
    => return shell 'export' command (for easier config)
- log (info level) all XRPC requests and responses. especially non-200 response bodies
- status should show more stuff, like DID from JWT token
    => and color!
- AtUri: at://jekyll.test/app.bsky.post/ (trailing slash should be allowed)
- include createdAt field, eg: "2022-10-28T06:10:12.106Z"
- 'get' could allow cid values (maybe with a prefix?)
- --help should mention env variables
- update top-level README
    => badges: AGPL, CI
