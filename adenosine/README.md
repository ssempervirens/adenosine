`adenosine`: library code for AT protocol (atproto.com)
==================================================================

This is a simple, enthusiast-grade library for the work-in-progress AT Protocol
([atproto.com](https://atproto.com)). It is used by both `adenosine-cli` and
`adenosine-pds`.

NOTE: this library code is currently AGPL, but will probably switch to
something permission (eg, MIT), with the applications staying AGPL.
