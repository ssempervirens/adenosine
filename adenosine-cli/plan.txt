CLI name is `adenosine`.

This is (for now) a "light" or "delegated" client which has no local state and
just talks to the remote.

config variables:

    ATP_SERVICE: prefix, eg http://localhost:1234
    ATP_AUTH_TOKEN: JWT string

at-uri can be either a global `at://` URI string, or a user-local referene of
the form <collection>/<TID>.

like in httpie, params can be '=' for a JSON field assignment; '==' for query
parameters (though there are usually CLI args instead); '@' to import a JSON
file; '-' to read a JSON file from stdin.

    ls <at-uri>?

    delete <at-uri>
