tauri GUI proof of concept:
- build on CLI utils?
- store config as TOML (serlialized) in some XDG location
- views:
    => initial config (register/login)
    => home (feed)
    => notifications
    => settings (profile, auth)
    => author view (profile, feed, followers, following)
    => create post
- buttons/actions:
    => like
    => follow
- could try htmx with only 'get' requests to pass args?
