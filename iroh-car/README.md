# iroh-car

[CAR file](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) support for iroh. "CAR" stands
for Content Addressable aRchives. A CAR file typically contains a serialized
representation of an [IPLD
DAG](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/merkle-dag/#merkle-directed-acyclic-graphs-dags),
though is general enough to contain arbitrary IPLD blocks.

Currently supports only [v1](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/).

It is part of [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh).
